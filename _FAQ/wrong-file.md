title: I turned in the wrong file. May I turn the right one in late?

My apologies, but I can't do anything that'd be a saving grace for
this instance. Please see the [general reasons we do not---cannot
accept late work]({{ site.baseurl }}/FAQ/late-work/). For this
specific situation, here is some advice.

I so love build infrastructure tooling, because we can chain things
together that test the zip files, and automatically build and execute
programs in a sandbox environment, and assure that they work, after
every time we build something. Things like this mix well with a git
repository, so that after every check-in, if you want, you can have it
testing that everything works like you want. If you want additional
assurance that a zip archive really and truly contains what you want,
where you want, and has contents that do what you want, this is one
way to achieve it.
