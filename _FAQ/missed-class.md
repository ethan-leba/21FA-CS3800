title: Can I attend online if I miss class? 
---

As we're a fully synchronous course this term, there aren't any Zoom
links or remote viewing options. We are making available both
professor and TA office hours online. This is also an especially
well-documented and well-studied area, there are plenty of available
online resources for following our text, and I've suggested we as a
class collect additional helpful explanations. Please recall our
policy on [daily quizzes]({{ site.baseurl }}/_FAQ/missed-poll/).
