title: This is a theory class. Why are we programming? 
---

A significant amount of the assignments in this course involve
programming. Yes, this is a theory class, but this is the theory of a
practical application. 

Applying your understanding of these theoretical concepts helps you to
transfer this information to a familiar domain (your own favorite
programming language) and acts a bridge between theory and practice.
As Olivier Danvy writes:

Furthermore, you should see this as an opportunity to use the skills
you've developed in your other classes in a new domain. Beyond using
some ordinary programming tools, we will not ask you for much in the
way of background. Most of the work of these assignments should be
internalizing the ideas and applying them in context. 

We might find that some problems really do _demand_ that we address
them with formal proof. If and when those come up we will adjust, but
at least for the time being plan as though you will be programming
your theory of computation assignments.
