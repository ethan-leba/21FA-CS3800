title: Are we pair programming? Do I have to? 
---

On both homeworks and projects, you will be working in groups of
between 2-4 people, which you all yourselves select from within your
lab section.

The designer of the NEU core CS curriculum considers pair programming,
incl. colleague management, coordination, in addition to the actual
peer review and communication of code, to be an essential learning
outcome. He places this on par with the technical proficiency that
students gain through these courses. I'm not prepared to deviate from
that part of the uniformly considered curriculum. Do consider this a
mandate. Your eclipse has built-in some software and tooling that we
have pre-installed to help more efficiently collaborate w/and between
group folk. 

We do have protocols in place for if groups aren't working out
well. Please see the appropriate sections in the syllabus for these,
and if things do not appear to be working out.

Please note that gradescope will not allow students to submit alone,
and that each submission must be with a group of between two and four
students.
