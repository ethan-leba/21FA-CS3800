title: How should I dispute or disagree with a grade I received?
---

For homework, please do file a regrade request with the direct issue
to address on gradescope, for that particular assignment. You should
see this option on a per-assignment basis.

If, after this discussion you still have questions, then please
continue the communication and ask to escalate with me, I'll be happy
to take a look at, and in light of, your prior discussions.

If this is for some non-gradescope portion of your grade, then please
do let me know what this is about and by email; I think I'm likely to
be the one who's most directly looked at this. 

And of course, if you feel that /I/ haven't given adequate
consideration to your situation or are otherwise unsatisfied, you
should of course raise your concerns with the [Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Education and
Experience](http://google.com/search?q=Associate+Dean+of+Undergraduate+Education+and+Experience+site:khoury.northeastern.edu&btnI)
at Khoury.
