title: What if I am absent from class due to Covid exposure or contract tracing!
---

The same guidelines for missing class for [any other reason]({{
site.baseurl}}/FAQ/missed-class/) apply. The same goes for the [daily
quizzes]({{ site.baseurl}}/FAQ/missed-poll/). We're in the full in
person modality, and so I don't have any Zoom or asynchronous modes
for attending class. We do however have associated readings on the
schedule that will help you supplement or in a pinch act as an ersatz
lecture replacement. This is also one of the most studied texts and
subjects in CS; we're collecting videos that people find really help
them understand the content as a third line of defense for
understanding. Please feel free to add to read from our list and add
to it.
