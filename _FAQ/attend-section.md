title: Do I need to attend my specific particular lab section? 
---

Yes. Barring unusual circumstances and pre-clearance with your
lecturer or lab instructor, you should plan to attend your specific
and particular lecture section and lab section. We are taking both
attendance and content-based polls over the pre-reading material, and
we will want to ensure that you are in your correct section. For labs,
this is also especially important so that you and your group can work
together when time allows in lab.

If you have unusual circumstances (flight out, interview) please let
me know and we can adjust manually.
