title: I feel like you've undercounted my lecture quizzes. What can I do?
---

If you submitted responses for a lecture quiz, the Gradescope tool
should show your submission. If those records show something different
than what I've recorded for you in Canvas, , please follow up with me
by email, and I can go compare against my data. If our data disagree
somehow, the Gradescope support has been very responsive.
