title: I feel like you've undercounted my Poll or other class participation. What can I do?
---

If you submitted responses for a poll question, the
[PollEverywhere](http://www.polleverywhere.com) site should show your
participation. I believe you find this under `History > Response
details`. If those records show something different than what I've
recorded for you, please follow up with me by email and include a
screen shot. I can go compare against my data. If our data disagree
somehow, their support has been very responsive.
