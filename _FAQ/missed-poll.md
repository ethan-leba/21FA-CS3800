title: I missed, due to internet, timing, microphone, a daily quiz. How can I make it up?

These are intentionally short-term, small, and un-make-uppable. These
are our functional analogues of an attendance, as well as feedback for
the instructor on how understanding is going. They lose their use in
one or both of these respects if we take after-the-fact answers, esp.
if we've then gone over the answer (on interesting questions) in
class. With the technology, we don't /have/ a way to do these in an
asynchronous format.
