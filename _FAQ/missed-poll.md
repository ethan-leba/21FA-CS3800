title: I missed, due to illness, timing, attendance, or interview, a daily quiz. How can I make it up?
---

These are intentionally short-term, small, and un-make-uppable. These
are our functional analogues of an attendance, as well as feedback for
the instructor on how understanding is going. They lose their use in
one or both of these respects if we take after-the-fact answers. I've
allowed everyone to drop ~5 or so of the daily quizzes, and in point
of fact the content and information for them should also be available
from the course website.
