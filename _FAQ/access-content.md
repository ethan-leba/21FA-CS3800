title: How do I access content not directly linked from the course website?
---

I will often store content from the course in a repository on the
[Khoury CCIS Github Enterprise server]({{ site.baseurl
}}/tech/#kccsccisccs-github) even if it's not directly linked from the
site itself. Since this content would have manifested just as pages of
links or an open directory on a file server, and since the Khoury
Github already provides this, I don't see any reason to duplicate
that. You can find a link to the site repository on the LHS of the
course home page.

Usually the content you want will be under `./assets/` in some obvious
location.
