# Waiting Room / Study Hall

We will use the Microsoft Teams Team room for this class as a standing
["study hall"
room](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a60905eee13be41edaf24bb474bb6feda%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=f452b406-b176-4311-a553-896cd36bfae7&tenantId=a8eec281-aaa3-4dae-ac9b-9a398b9215e7),
and a waiting room where students should virtually wait for our staff
will go to find you when it is your turn. If you can help another
student without "giving away the punchline" of a question or
assignment, then that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Helping
someone else get unstuck is one of the more productive things you can
do while you are yourself stuck and waiting for help!

We encourage you to, while stuck, try and help a fellow student who
could benefit from what you might already know how to explain.

# Office Hours Location and Format

For obvious reasons, this semester we will hold office hours
remotely. Our TA staff will use the [Khoury Office Hours
system](https://khouryofficehours.com/), helping students on a
first-come, first-serve basis. Jason has linked his calendar so you
can [book a 20 minute
appointment](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUVKdFI5MHpUQ1FlfGRlZmF1bHR8ZTIwOGYzMTQ1NjFjNTRlNDU4NDZmODc5MmFiMjIxNGI)
for a Teams call during his office hours. Otherwise [email me]({{
site.baseurl }}/syllabus/#contact) for an appointment.
