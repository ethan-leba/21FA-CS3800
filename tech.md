## [Duo 2FA](https://get2fa.northeastern.edu/)

Most if not all students will already have enrolled themselves for the
Duo 2FA system. It is essential that you do so to access
Northeastern's digital resources. Northeastern has at least two
tutorials for installing and using the Duo 2FA system:

   - [The express version](https://express.northeastern.edu/get2fa/how-to-enroll-in-2fa/)
   - [The `servicenow` guide, (with pictures)](https://northeastern.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sys_kb_id=436cd1dbdb808854c5575e38dc9619e3&sysparm_class_name=kb_knowledge)

## Piazza 

[Piazza.com](http://piazza.com/) hosts our main Q&A forum. We are
everyone learning; no one knows all the answers, and remember that
everyone wears their best and most knowledgeable face. For questions
related to the course material, assignments, policies, or what have
you, please utilize Piazza. I generally prefer anonymous Piazza posts
over email---this way others get the benefit of your thoughtful
question and answers and corrections scale to the size of our class.
Please do anonymize them if you wish; we can see even if you cannot.
Frequently someone will have the same concern or be feeling the same
way.

 If it doesn't "give away the punchline" of some homework question or
 assignment, *necessitate* PII in the question or the answer, and isn't
 contrary to FERPA or your rights under the Northeastern University
 Handbook, please do consider if this can be a Piazza message.

## [KCCS/CCIS/CCS Github](http://ccs.github.neu.edu)

I will be utilizing the school's Enterprise git at
[http://ccs.github.neu.edu]. You should have access to that with your
KCCS account. I will expect you to know how to access this, for your
own benefits and for coursework. If you are not familiar, please
consult the Khoury Systems group's [documentation and
walk-through](https://northeastern.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0012152).

## Course Homepage

I constructed our course homepage as a Jekyll site built with Github
Pages. Student corrections and improvements are *incredibly* welcome!
You can submit a [pull request
(PR)](http://github.ccs.neu.edu/jhemann/21SP-2800) for a quick
correction and improvement. Every page on this website has a direct
links to its `.md` file in this repository.


## NEU VPN 

Go to [https://vpn.northeastern.edu](https://vpn.northeastern.edu), and follow the instructions to
install the GlobalProctect VPN client on your machine. You will need
this to use the VDI linux machines. If you have difficulty please
consult the [relevant ITS KB articles](http://northeastern.service-now.com/tech?id=kb_category&kb_category=07d42f714f02cf0099c2fd511310c7b2), and if necessary [reach out to
ITS support](http://its.northeastern.edu/support/#et-boc:~:text=Still%20Need%20Support%3F).

## VDI Linux Machines 

You can use the Khoury Virtual Desktops Infrastructure (VDI). See the
[documentation](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/systems/vdi/). You
have many options including using an [HTML
client](https://view.khoury.northeastern.edu/portal/webclient/index.html#/)
that allows you to log into a virtual machine and run ACL2s using a
browser. Use your Khoury CS account credentials and select
`CCIS-WINDOWS`; then select `Linux Lab` and you will see a Desktop.
You may also visit the [relevant ITS KB
articles](http://northeastern.service-now.com/tech?id=kb_category&kb_category=6b863d8d4f3b5b4450a5798e0210c735&kb_id=d82ad28c134922401528f5104244b068).
