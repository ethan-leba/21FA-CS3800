Welcome to the "Theory of Computation" for Fall 2021. We aim to highlight the practical importance of the
basic theory of computation in the everyday lives of working software developers and computer scientists. This
course will teach you how to prove theorems about your programs. You will learn the importance of thinking
logically when designing your programs, and the benefits of tooling that helps to check your programs are
correct.
