Welcome to the "Logic and Computation" for Spring 2021. We hope this
will be an education and enjoyable experience. We endeavor to
spotlight the logical underpinnings of skills you have previously
learned, and also to contextualize the deep connections between
mathematical logic and computation. This course will teach you how to
prove theorems about your programs. You will learn the importance of
thinking logically when designing your programs, and the benefits of
tooling that helps to check your programs are correct.
